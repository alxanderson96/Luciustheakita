Ball pythons like to hide, so the more cluttered the better
</p>
Things you need:
<li>hide</li>
<li>heat lamp with a dimmer</li>
<li>terrarium (there's many options)</li>
<li>substrate</li>
<li>food of the appropriate size</li>
<li>water bowl (that the snake can't tip)</li>
<li>spray bottle or humidifiier</li>
<p>I've raised my female Ball Python for the last 3 years, and this some of my own experience, and from sources that I trust whole-heartedly. </p>
<p>Once you get the handle on taking care of Ball python, and get them on a good routine, then it becomes a lot easier. </p>
Daily Morning Routine:
<ul>1. turn on the heat lamp, and check temperatures</ul>
<ul>2. check humidity and boost humidity by using humidifier or using a spray bottle</ul>
<ul>3. I always will look at my snake, and do a "wellness check". (i.e Check to see if she's shedding, 
    make sure she's hasn't escaped, etc. ) </ul>
Nightly Routine:
<ul>1. check temperatures, and humidity</ul>
<ul>2. do another wellness check</ul>
<ul>3. shut off heat lamp (if it's cold in my room, then I'll use a Ceramic Heat Emitter. It puts out a lot of heat, so I only use it in Winter)</ul>

<p>The temperature range you should be keeping 
    Basking surface — 95-105°F (35-40°C)
    Ambient/air — 82-86°F (28-30°C)
    Night drop — 72-78°F (22-26°C)</p>
    <p>Humidity should on average be 55% to 65%. The average humidity in Utah (where I live) is about 30%, and needs to be lifted. If your snake is shedding, and then the humidity needs to be higher.</p>
