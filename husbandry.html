Ball pythons like to hide, so the more cluttered the better
</p>
Things you need:
<li>hide</li>
<li>heat lamp with a dimmer</li>
<li>terrarium (there's many options)</li>
<li>substrate</li>
<li>food of the appropriate size</li>
<li>water bowl (that the snake can't tip)</li>
<li>spray bottle or humidifiier</li>
<p>I've raised my female Ball Python for the last 3 years, and this some of my own experience, and from sources that I trust whole-heartedly. </p>
<p>Once you get the handle on taking care of Ball python, and get them on a good routine, then it becomes a lot easier. </p>
Daily Morning Routine:
<ul>1. turn on the heat lamp, and check temperatures</ul>
<ul>2. check humidity and boost humidity by using humidifier or using a spray bottle</ul>
<ul>3. I always will look at my snake, and do a "wellness check". (i.e Check to see if she's shedding, or ) </ul>
<p>The video linked down below has some amazing info! </p>
