        <p>Ball pythons can be picky due to their docile nature. </p>
        <p>Some will only eat certain colors, or at a certain temperature. Some have no issues.</p>
        <p>The best way to feed Ball Pythons is using Frozen Thawed rats. There is no chance that the rat will bite.</p>
        <p>Rats bites have been known to cause infection.</p>
        <p>This goes back to the picky nature of the Ball Python. Some will only eat live, and that means when the rat/mouse is in the enclosure with them, then you must be supervising them.</p>
        <p>I've seen it recommended to feed your ball python in a seperate container, because they will associate your hands with food. I'm going to let you into an inside tip about reptiles. They do not have that much forethought. Plus handling your ball pythons after feeding can jeopordize their health.</p>
        <p>Something that I've only recently discovered, is that Ball pythons need calcium supplements. It does help their bones to be stronger, and something that you should do with an adult every 4th feeding, and with babies, every feeding.</p>
