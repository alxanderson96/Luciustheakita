        How to handle a ball python:
        <ul>1.Wash your hands before any contact.</ul>
        <ul>2.Start Slow! Work your way up to long term contact</ul>
        <ul>3. Remember that bites are bound to happen, especially if you're holding food, or you scared the snake. (Something my grandma always told me. If it has teeth it can bite. Bites aren't a big deal.)</ul>
        <ul>4. Be Gentle, and young kids should be supervised when handling snakes.</ul>
        <ul>5. Snakes SHOULD NOT be handled after eating. They can regurgitate their food, and it will require a visit to your Exotic Veternarian. </ul>
